Sample R codes for running Algorithm 1 in the paper: Sixu Liu and Yaping Wang (2023). New bounds and search for maximin distance U-type designs. summitted.
The file criteria_functions.R contains some basic and space-filling criteria functions.
The file alg1.R contains main code for implementing Algorithm 1. An example for generating a five-level maximin distance U-type design with 30 runs and 15 factors is also included.
